# OpenGL Custom Game Engine

This project was made as a test for creating a custom 2D game engine using OpenGL. The purpose of this project is to gain experience in creating large and complex applications with C++. 

## Features:
* 2D sprite creation and texture caching.
* Asset browser (for navigating and managing project files). This includes icons, file searching, and dynamic table layout (depending on the size of the window).
* Music and sound effects.
* Built-in audio manager (for adding sound effects and changing properties of sound effects that will be used in-game).
* Scene creation and saving capabilities.
* Keyboard input management system.

## How to Run the Project:
1. Open the 'OpenGL' folder.
2. Run the 'GenerateProject.bat' file to generate the solution file.
3. Open the 'OrbiterEngine.sln' file in Visual Studio.

## Libraries Used:
* Glad - API function loader for OpenGL.
* GLFW - OpenGL framework used for input handling and window creation.
* tinyfiledialogs - dialog box library for C.
* OpenAL - 3D audio API.
* glm - OpenGL mathematics library.
* Dear ImGui - GUI library for C++.
* Premake - Build tool for creating and configuring project files.

## What I Learned:
* File creation, writing, and parsing.
* Using GLSL to write shader logic.
* Using raw and smart pointers for memory management.
* Working with third-party libraries to improve development time.
* Setting up complex project structures.
