# OpenGL Custom Game Engine

This project was made as a test for creating a custom 2D game engine using OpenGL. The purpose of this project is to gain experience in creating large and complex applications with C++. 

## Features:
* 2D sprite creation and texture caching.
* Asset browser (for navigating and managing project files). This includes icons, file searching, and dynamic row and column count (depending on the size of the window).
* Music and sound effects.
* Built-in audio manager (for adding sound effects and changing properties of sound effects that will be used in-game).
* Scene creation and saving capabilities.
* Keyboard input management system.
